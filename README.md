# FB Chat Bot
Everyone who has used IRC or Twitch or Discord knows about group bots. They're pretty cool. I wanted one for my group chat. I also wanted to learn at least a little bit of Python, see what's the hype about. And, well, here it is - a Python FB Chat Bot.

So far it's pretty basic it supports keeping track of stats and only has a few basic commands.
The most interesting feature as of now is a game - quiz. Most importantly some infrastacture is laid there to make implementing new things very easy.

## How to use
1. Create a FB account, join the group chat and copy `thread_id` which you see in address bar.
2. Enter data into `config.json`. You can edit a lot of stuff through it.
3. Launch `fb-chat-bot.py`.
